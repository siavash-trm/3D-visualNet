Combining 3D brain MRI and Tabular Data for 3D Tumor Segmentation , Tumor type , genomic analysis and prognosis prediction
# Multi-Input 3D Brain Tumor Segmentation and Classification Model

This repository contains code and architecture for a deep learning model that performs **3D brain tumor segmentation** using multimodal inputs â€” 3D MRI volumes and tabular clinical data. The model also predicts **five classification outputs** related to patient-level diagnosis , prognosis and genomics .

## ðŸ§  Project Overview

- **Goal**:
  - Accurately segment brain tumors from 3D MRI scans.
  - Predict 5 classification outputs based on multimodal input.
- **Inputs**:
  - 3D MRI volumes (NIfTI format)
  - Tabular patient data (CSV)
- **Outputs**:
  - Binary 3D segmentation mask
  - Five classification heads ( tumor type, mutation status, relapse)
